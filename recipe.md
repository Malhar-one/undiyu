Step 1
To start with, first we have to make methi muthias. For the same, take a deep bowl and mix together salt and fenugreek leaves in water and soak the leaves for about 7-8 minutes. When done, squeeze out all the water from the leaves and throw away the liquid.

Step 2
To the bowl full of soaked fenugreek leaves, add whole wheat flour, gram flour, chilli powder, ginger, green chilli paste, turmeric powder along with sugar, a pinch of baking soda and 1 1/2 tsp olive oil. Mix well all the ingredients and add a little water in the bowl and knead the mixture into a smooth dough. When done, divide the dough into equal portions and roll each potions in between the palms into a round shape.

Step 3
Now, to fry the muthias, put a non-stick kadhai on medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, add the muthias in the hot oil and deep fry them until golden brown in colour. When all the muthias are fried, transfer them on an absorbent paper to absorb the extra oil.

Step 4
Now, take peeled baby potatoes, sliced pieces of banana and small eggplants and make slits in the centre without splitting it completely. Next, Make a coconut-coriander masala by adding chilli powder, sugar, grated coconut, chopped coriander, green garlic, cumin seed powder, coriander powder, green chilli paste, ginger paste and salt as taste to the bowl. Mix well all the ingredients into a stuffing and by using a spoon stuff this masala into the slits of eggplants, bananas and potatoes.

Step 5
Afterwards, take a large bowl and mix together the fresh surti vaal, yam, toor daal, and the remaining coconut-coriander masala. Keep the bowl aside to marinate for at least 10 minutes.

Step 6
Finally, put a pressure cooker on medium flame and heat oil in it. Add carom seeds in the cooker and saute on medium flame until they crackle. Then, add asafoetida (hing) along with baking soda in the cooker, and fry for a few seconds. Now, add stuffed potatoes and eggplants in the cooker and increase the flame to high. Cover the cooker with a lid and cook all the vegetables for 2 whistles. After 2 whistles, switch off the burner and let the steam release on its own.

Step 7
Open the lid and toss the contents of the cooker, and then add the stuffed bananas along with fried methi muthias on top. Put the cooker once again on low flame and cook till the bananas are tender and soft while stirring occasionally. Transfer the dish to a serving platter and garnish with coriander leaves. Serve hot and enjoy!
